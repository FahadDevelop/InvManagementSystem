In this Github repo, we present to you our Java Project, that provides an Inventory Management System, in a menu-driven style. It allows store managers to do the following:

- Add new products to the inventory
- View the list of all the products
- Update the price/quantity of selected product
- Delete products that are no longer needed
- Search for products using their ID

It has been tested to handle basic exceptions, like giving an invalid input, or searching for a non-existing product.

This work is for our Introduction to Computing Science II course project, and this is our final submission of it.
